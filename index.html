			Hey Bebuuuuuuuu or should i say my pharmacist or should i say my golu ya my tamatrrrrr, omg i hope you arent tired of me giving you cute names every other day.<br /><br>
				
			Let me just address you today by My Bachha. Well becoz you are my sweet little bacha and you love it when i call you that.<br /><br>

			My Baccha, I cant be thankful enough since the day you have graced your feet in my life. The life has changed my baccha. It has changed for good, for best. Since then i have been the happiest men on this planet earth.
			Each day makes me feel how lucky i am to have you in my life bebu. I cant be grateful enough of mummyjaan and papajaan that they have got you in this world. If it wouldnt be for them then i wouldnt have had the good deeds
			to have you in my life. And I cant be grateful enough to upparwale that he sent me the most beautiful person, the most kindess person, the most cutest, the most ...... omg the list will just go on becoz bebu you are the one.<br /><br>

			Jaan, have you heard of october theory? Well this aint scientific theory but something social media but it states that during october you find someone really really special or someone really really special leaves you. Well bebu October 2023 has been the most special month in my 25 years of life.
			Without you bebu there aint me and with you i am everything jaan. Thankyou bebu for just jelofies me everytime. Thank you for still holding onto me becoz i know i am not a easy one to be loved.<br><br>

			Bebu, you came in my life when i wasnt looking for anyone and guess what you just became the bestest unplanned part which happenend in my life.

			Subabh jab jagta hun tabh tere muskaan se jagta hun, jab din guzarta hun tabh tere khayalo mein dooba hota hun and jab din khatam karta hun tabh tere khawab dekh kar karta hun. You are not just part of my life bebu, you are my life. <br / ><br>

			Mein to tumhara ho gaya hun <br />
			tum hasaoge toh hasunga, tum rulaoge toh rounga <br />
			accha hun toh tumara hun, bura hun tabh bhi tumara hun<br /><br>

			What better way can i find for my computer science girl to wish her?. <br /><br>

			Bebu the memories we have created, the moments we have lived omg its just like a fairytale. Our own little picture where we both are the hero and heroine.
			I still cant believe what we have come upto, like everything feels so different with you, everything feels so special with you. 
			I am very very very proud of you my girl. You do everything in your capability to give everything to out relationship. Bebu the day i saw you for the first time i felt something different, or shall i say i smelled something different :) :)
			No baccha, but really really i felt something different on that day, you know how two magnets when come into vicinity get pulled, just like that bebu i got pulled to you, your eyes omg they make me go crazy, your hair makes me go wild, your smile makes me fall everyday,
			your smell makes me bonkers everyday, your touch makes me go into baby mode everyday, your love activates my all senses. Jaan, i know it has been tough sometimes but trust me i want the good as well as the bad with you and only you. <br /><br>

			Our Bond has just grown stronger and stronger <br />
			Journey from workplace to nightstay to livein to longdistance has been just like wowwwwwwww <br />
			Now waiting to add happily married <br />

			Bebu, i know at this point in the message you are feeling like i should just keep on going and going but to be very honest this aint enough to describe what i feeel for you, this aint enought to describe what i think of you, this aint enough to say............ <br /><br>

			All I want to say is <br />
			Prem bhi tum <br />
			Dost bhi tum <br />
			Zindagi bhi tum <br />
			Gussa bhi tum <br />
			Maafi bhi tum <br />
			Ek bhi tum <br />
			Unlimited bhi tum <br />
			Zindagi ke safar mein, kafi ho tum <br /><br>

			Happy the most beautiful day !!!! Happy the most amazing star constellation day !!! Happy love day !!!
			Happy Two Year my wifeeeyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
